### TypeScript Experiments

A project created to learn more about typescript

### What is TypeScript?

* Javascript Superset - Adds new features, make writing JS easier
* Browser cant execute it directly - But TS compiler compiles the TS code into JS code
* TS compiler compiles the new features and code into JS workaround code (Which we would have written ourselves otherwise)
* Nicer syntax, adds types feature which helps identify errors earlier during compile time 
* It will force you write better, cleaner and less error prone code
