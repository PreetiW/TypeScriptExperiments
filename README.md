## TypeScript Experiments

A project created to learn more about typescript

## What is TypeScript?

- Javascript Superset - Adds new features, make writing JS easier
- Browser cant execute it directly - But TS compiler compiles the TS code into JS code
- TS compiler compiles the new features and code into JS workaround code (Which we would have written ourselves otherwise)
- Nicer syntax, adds types feature which helps identify errors earlier during compile time
- It will force you write better, cleaner and less error prone code

## Using Types

### Core Primitive Types (all lower case)

- number - all types of numeric values such as 1, 2.4, -3
- boolean - true/false
- string - values can be written as 'demo', "demo" , `demo`
